There are two folders in delta_documentation:
* The Scilab_resources: where it can be found some tools for designing the delta robot. Basically, there is the function that
solves the direct kinematics problem and around it there are some scripts for plotting, checking designs and so on.
* The wxMax_eqs: contains an .html file that can be opened with any explorer. This file explains the symbolic equation development
to get the equations applied in the Scilab resources.
